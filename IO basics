#File IO basics
"""
"r"- open file for reading
"w"- open file for writing
"x"-create file if not exist
"a"- add more content to file
"t"- text mode
"b"-binary mode
"+"-read and write mode
"""
#f = open("rai.txt","rt")
#in rb it will be read in binary mode
#f = open("rai.txt","rt")
#rt is the default mode
#content = f.read()
#whatever no of characters we write inside the bracket of read it will read that many characters
#print(content)

#content = f.read()
#the next no of characters will be printed in this one
#print(content)
##    print(line,end="")
#print(f.readline())
#the number of time you write the above line that many lines will be written
#print(f.readlines())
# in this one it will read all the lines
#f.close()
